| Name                                       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application                                | Made up of components                                        |
| Services & Dependency Injection            | Provide functionality across components                      |
| Component                                  | Template (View), Class (Code for the view, properties and methods), Metadata (Provides information to Angular) |
| Modules                                    | Groups components into cohesive blocks of functionality.     |
| ES Modules                                 | Code files that import or export `things`. These organize our code files. Modularize our code. Promote code reuse. |
| Angular Modules                            | Code files that organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Organize our application. Modularize our application. Promote application boundaries. |
| Templates                                  | View layout fragment, created with HTML, includes Angular binding and directives in the HTML. [Templates can be specified in 3 ways](templates.md). |
| Template resolution environment            | When the Angular Compiler see's a directive like `<pm-root></pm-root>` in a template it looks to the Angular Module for the definition. This is under `declarations` |
| Interpolation                              | Double curley braces that bind data from the class files properties into the template. One way binding.<br />EG: `{{pageTitle}}`<br />Supports operations such as concatenation, calculations and method calls:<br />EG: `{{Title: + pageTitle}}`<br />EG: `{{2*20+1}}`<br />EG: `{{'Title: ' + getTitle()}}`<br />EG: `<h1 innerText={{pageTitle}}></h1>` |
| Template Expression                        | The syntax between the interpolatation curley braces is called the template expression. EG:<br />pageTitle in `{{pageTitle}}`<br /><br />Angual will evaluate this expression using the component as the context. |
| Directives                                 | Custom HTML element or attribute used to power up and extend our HTML |
| Built-in Directives: Structural Directives | `*ngIf` : this is a if condition<br />`*ngFor` : this is a loop<br /><br />the `*` in front of the directive name means its a structural directive<br /> |
| `*ngIf`                                    | Removes or recreates a  protion of the DOM tree based on an expression, if the expression evaluates to false, the element and its children are removed from the DOM. If true, the element and its children are re-inserted into the DOM.<br />EG: `<table *ngIf='products && products.length'></table>`<br /><br />`ngIf` is exposed in the `BrowserModule` module. |
| `*ngFor`                                   | Repeats a portion of the DOM tree in an iterable list<br />EG: `<tr *ngFor='let product of products'>`<br />`of` iterates over iterable objects such as an array.<br /><br />`in` iterates over the properties of an object<br />EG: `let nicknames = ['foo', 'bar', 'bazz']`<br />`for (let nickname in nicknames) { console.log(nickname) }`<br />RESULT: `0,1,2` |
| Data binding                               | Renders property values from the class in the HTML:<br /><br />Interpolation: `{{ pageTitle }}`<br />Property Binding: `<img [src]='product.imageUrl'>`<br />Event Binding: `<button (click)='toggleImage()'>`<br />2 Way Binding: `<input [(ngModel)]='listFilter'/>` |
| Pipes                                      | Transform bound properties before they are displayed. Built in pipes include:<br />* date<br />* Upper/Lower case<br />* number, decimal, percent, currency<br />* json, slice<br /><br />Chain pipes<br />`{{ product.price | currency | lowercase }}`<br /><br />Pipe parameters<br />`{{ product.price | currency:'USD':'symbol':'1.2-2' }}`<br />Here `USD` is the desired currency code, `symbol` is a string defining how to show the currency symbol and `1.2-2` is didgit info. 1 is the minimum number of integer digits, .2 is the minimum fractional digits and -2 is the maxium number for fractional digits. |
| Retrieve Data Using HTTP                   |                                                              |
| Navigation                                 |                                                              |
| Routing                                    |                                                              |
| CLI (Command Line Interface)               |                                                              |
| Transpiled                                 | New JS (JavaScript) features in code must be compiled by a tool that converts the new JS syntax (ES2015) to comprable older syntax the browser can understand. |
| TypeScript                                 | Strongly typed and Open source super set of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript. |
| ES5                                        |                                                              |
| ES2015 (ES6)                               | Is Class-based object-orientated, allows for interfaces and inheritance.<br /><br />(TODO - interfaces/inheritance may be a typescript thing and not ES2015??) |
| package.json                               | Stores dependencies (libruarys/packages) that your application needs to run, NPM will download and install these to `node_modules` |
| Lazy Load                                  |                                                              |
| Load on start                              |                                                              |
| Decorator                                  | Used to define MetaData on a component. Its a function that adds MetaData to a class, its members or its method arguments.<br /><br />EG: `@Component({ })`<br />EG: `@NgModule({ })`<br />EG: `@HostListener()`<br />EG: `@Pipe({})`<br />EG: `@Input() rating: number;`<br />EG: `@Output() ratingClicked: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();` |
|                                            |                                                              |
| MetaData                                   | Provides extra data for Angular, the metadata defines the class as an Angular component. |
| selector                                   | Defines the components directive name, the perfix **pm** relates to your project. The examples from [Deborah Kurata](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/deborah-kurata) was for a Product Manger, so she used **pm**.<br /><br />EG: `selector: 'pm-root'` |
| directive name                             | Custom HTML tag, this is the name used to inject the component template into the  HTML<br /><br />EG: `<pm-root></pm-root>` |
| Angular Compiler                           | ~~JIT (Just in time compiler)~~, depricated in Angular V9    |
| Angular Compiler                           | Ahead of Time compiler (AOT), used during development, pre-compiles before serving. From V9 used for deployment, pre-compiles before deploying.<br /><br />Terminal window (Editor) is the source of truth for **compile** related errors. |
| Bootstrapping                              | Self starting process that loads and goes                    |
| Binding                                    | Coordinates communication between the componet's class and its template and often involves passing data. |
| Property Binding                           | Allows us to set a property value of an element to the value of a template expression.<br />EG:<br /><br /><img [src]='product.imageUrl'<br/>                            [title]='product.productName'<br/>                            [style.width.px]='imageWidth'<br/>                            [style.margin.px]='imageMargin'> |
| Event Binding                              | This is how a component listens for use actions.<br />EG: `<button (click)='toggleImage()'>`<br /><br />Here the bound target event is closed in parentheses: `(click)` and the template statement is the method to be called.<br /><br />List of DOM events:<br /><br />https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events |
| Two-way Binding                            | This is displaying a component class property in the template and update that property when the user makes a change. This is done with the `ngModel` directive. <br /><br />EG: `<input [(ngModel)]='listFilters'`, this is commonly called bananna in a box `[()]`<br />The square brackets mean property binding and parentheses to indecate event binding.<br /><br />`ngModel` will need to be imported from `FormsModule` in the module that owns your component. |
| Interface                                  | A specification identifying a related set of properties and methods. A class will commit to supporting the specification by implmenting the interface, we can then use the interface as a data type. The interface will however be transpiled out and not found in the resulting Javascript, this means they are for development time only to support strong typing and debugging. |
| Encapsulating Component Styles             | When a template requires unique styles we dont want these to leak out into other templates. These can be specified in the `@Component` decorator in two ways<br /><br />`styles: ['thead {color: #CCC}']`<br />or<br />`styleUrls: ['./product-list.component.css']` |
| Componnet Lifecycle Hooks                  | Create -> Render -> Create and render children -> Process changes -> Destroy<br /><br />EG:<br /><br />`export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit { ...` <br />`ngOnInit(): void { ...` |
| OnInit                                     | Perform any component initialzation after Angular has initialzed the data bound properties. We can also retrieve data from a back end service in this Lifecycle Hook. |
| OnChanges                                  | Peform action after change to input properties               |
| OnDestroy                                  | Any cleanup needed before Angular destroys the component.    |
| Backing field                              | This is a private member used to store state<br />EG: `private _listFilter: string'` |
| Getter                                     | Used to return backing field<br />EG: `get listFilter() : string { return this._listFilter; }`<br />Its accessed as if it was a property <br />EG: `console.log(this.listFilter);` |
| Setter                                     | Used to set the backing field<br />EG: `set listFilter(value: string) { this._listFilter = value; }`<br />Its accessed as if it was a property <br />EG: `this.listFilter = 'foo';` |
