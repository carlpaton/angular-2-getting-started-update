After intalling bootstrap with [NMP](npm.md) you need to import the `.css` files to be using in your application.

In `\src\styles.css` add the following

```css
@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

The same is applicable for any other installed CSS library's 

```css
@import "~font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css";
```
